Instructions:
The objective of Montana Solitaire is to order all the cards in horizontal rows from Two to King, left to right, in the same suit.
An empty spot may be filled with a card that is the same suit and one rank higher than the card to the left.
The most left spot may only be filled with a Two.
Nothing may be placed to the right of a King.
Clicking the shuffle button will randomly rearrange all the cards on the tableau that are not already in order.
There is a limit to how many times you can reshuffle.
